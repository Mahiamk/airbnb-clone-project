## Feature Breakdown

1. User Management
Handles registration, authentication, and profile updates. Users can create an account, log in securely, and manage personal information. This feature ensures secure access and identity control throughout the platform.

2. Property Management
Allows users (typically hosts) to list, update, and remove properties. They can input details such as title, description, pricing, and location. This is the foundation of the platform‚Äôs inventory.

3. Booking System
Enables guests to search for and book available properties. It includes booking creation, updates, and status management. This system links users and properties with date-specific availability.

4. Payment Processing
Processes transactions related to bookings. It securely handles payment details, statuses, and timestamps. This ensures hosts get paid and guests can reserve properties with confidence.

5. Review System
Lets users leave reviews and ratings after their stay. Helps improve transparency, build trust, and guide future guests in making informed decisions.

6. API Documentation
Uses OpenAPI standards and GraphQL to describe and interact with backend APIs. This improves developer experience and facilitates smooth frontend-backend collaboration.

7. Database Optimization
Implements indexing and caching mechanisms. These improve performance by speeding up frequent queries and reducing database load.
