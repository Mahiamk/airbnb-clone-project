## Feature Breakdown

1. User Management
Handles registration, authentication, and profile updates. Users can create an account, log in securely, and manage personal information. This feature ensures secure access and identity control throughout the platform.

2. Property Management
Allows users (typically hosts) to list, update, and remove properties. They can input details such as title, description, pricing, and location. This is the foundation of the platform’s inventory.

3. Booking System
Enables guests to search for and book available properties. It includes booking creation, updates, and status management. This system links users and properties with date-specific availability.

4. Payment Processing
Processes transactions related to bookings. It securely handles payment details, statuses, and timestamps. This ensures hosts get paid and guests can reserve properties with confidence.

5. Review System
Lets users leave reviews and ratings after their stay. Helps improve transparency, build trust, and guide future guests in making informed decisions.

6. API Documentation
Uses OpenAPI standards and GraphQL to describe and interact with backend APIs. This improves developer experience and facilitates smooth frontend-backend collaboration.

7. Database Optimization
Implements indexing and caching mechanisms. These improve performance by speeding up frequent queries and reducing database load.

## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is essential to protect sensitive user data, ensure platform integrity, and maintain user trust. The following key security measures will be implemented:

🛡️ Key Security Measures
Authentication

Implements secure login mechanisms using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth.

Verifies that a user is who they claim to be before allowing access.

🔒 Why it's important: Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and personal data.

Authorization

Restricts actions based on user roles (e.g., guests cannot edit listings).

Ensures users can only access data they own or are permitted to view.

🔒 Why it's important: Protects sensitive resources and maintains data integrity.

Rate Limiting

Limits the number of requests per user/IP to prevent abuse.

Deters brute-force login attempts and API spamming.

🔒 Why it's important: Enhances platform reliability and reduces risk of DoS attacks.

Data Validation and Sanitization

Validates all inputs from clients to prevent injection attacks.

Sanitizes data to protect against XSS and SQL injection.

🔒 Why it's important: Prevents attackers from injecting malicious code or commands.

HTTPS and Encryption

Enforces secure communication through HTTPS.

Encrypts sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment info) both in transit and at rest.

🔒 Why it's important: Keeps data private and secure from interception.

CORS Policies

Restricts which domains can interact with the API.

🔒 Why it's important: Prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests and data leaks.

🔐 Security Across Project Areas
User Management: Protects login credentials and personal information from unauthorized access.

Booking System: Prevents fraudulent reservations and tampering with booking data.

Payment Processing: Secures financial transactions and protects users from fraud.

Review System: Ensures that reviews are posted by verified users, maintaining platform credibility.

## CI/CD Pipeline

📌 What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery. It's a development practice that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code to ensure fast, safe, and consistent delivery of updates.

Continuous Integration (CI) automatically tests and merges code changes to the main branch as soon as developers push their commits. This helps catch bugs early and ensures the codebase remains stable.

Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) automates the release process, pushing changes to production or staging environments once they pass all tests.

🚀 Why CI/CD is Important for This Project
Faster Development: Automates repetitive tasks like testing and building.

Higher Code Quality: Runs tests on every change to catch errors quickly.

Improved Collaboration: Developers can work in parallel without breaking the main codebase.

Safe Deployments: Reduces human error and ensures consistent deployment steps across environments.

🛠️ Tools Used
GitHub Actions: Automates workflows like running tests and deploying code when changes are pushed to the repository.

Docker: Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production using containerization.

PostgreSQL (for test environment): A consistent database setup for CI test pipelines.

Heroku / Render / AWS / GCP: (Optional) Platforms for deploying the app from CI pipelines.
